# Dream-blog
This repository is similar to the [evcoreas/Blog-App](https://github.com/evcoreas/Blog-App) repository.
But this is an UPDATED Verison. I created this simple Blog Web Application using RESTful routing architecture method. As well as using MongoDB for the database, Passport for authentication, Express, EJS for the javascript templating engine, Node.js and Semantic UI for the styling.
