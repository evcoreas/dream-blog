# Dream-blog
This repository is similar to the [evcoreas/Blog-App](https://github.com/evcoreas/Blog-App) repository.
I created this simple Blog Web Application focusing mainly on the RESTful routing architecture. I created this app using
MongoDB fot the database, Express, EJS for the javascript templating engine, Node.js and Semantic UI for the styling.

### Hosted on Heroku
